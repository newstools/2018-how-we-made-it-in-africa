 The Africa Insurance and Reinsurance Conference, a regionally focused event now in its 8th edition has steadily become a gateway for the global and regional investors to engage local leaders as they seek ways to increase insurance penetration in the continent. Notwithstanding unprecedented economic growth (a substantial component of this dependent on the financial and insurance sector), industry experts say that the insurance market in the continent still remain small and comparatively underdeveloped. The growth potential going forward is therefore significantly high and insurance industry must strive for competitive excellence by increasingly seeking new growth markets and products. The 8th Africa Insurance and Reinsurance Conference themes will therefore be along the lines of: “Innovate to Capture the Growth Potential”. Africa continues to offer significant potential for future investment. Sustainable economic expansion and demographic transformation are making the insurance market more attractive, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. As the industry rides the wave of growth in this second-fastest growing region in the World, the scale of opportunity is compelling. Low market penetration is giving way to rising consumer demand and new technologies. In this shifting landscape, organic growth is a greater priority than mergers and acquisitions (M&A) or new products. Come meet and network with industry leaders who encounter, and solve, the same challenges you see every day. Learn how to gain a competitive advantage, benchmark your strategies, deliver a better customer experience, and so much more. Register today.
