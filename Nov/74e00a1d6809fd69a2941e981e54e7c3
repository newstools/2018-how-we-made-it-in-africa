Michelle Kathryn Essomé I am blessed because I love my job. But some worries include: Are we delivering for our members? Are we doing all that we can to sell Africa? Are we excelling at what we do? Is the team advancing and growing in their roles? And, what more can be done? Tenacity, constantly learning, and being client-centric. Probably that we only do an annual conference, when in fact, we are focussed on catalysing investment into Africa through our vast research, training and advocacy. AVCA has been solely focussed on these efforts for nearly 20 years. Dr Myra L. Taylor, my paternal grandmother, who unfortunately left us too soon. She finished college and graduate school, and did an executive programme at Harvard in theology, all whilst being a wife, mom of two young adults, and C-level member of a large US Christian organisation. She was driven, grateful and generous. Learn as much as possible about your job and do your very best. Success is when Africa attracts as much, if not more, private capital than other emerging markets. I have a toddler so relaxing can sometimes be elusive, but when the occasion does present itself, I read, go to the cinema and theatre, cook for friends and travel. As with any CEO, I’m constantly connected and working – whether I’m at my desk or on the road. But overall, I’m an early riser. What can you bring to this role that no other candidate can? When investors commit to Africa and AVCA has played a part in making that commitment. Michelle Kathryn Essomé is CEO of the African Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (AVCA), a pan-African industry body which aims to catalyse, promote and enable private equity and venture capital investment in Africa.
