 This year How we made it in Africa will live stream the Anzisha Prize pitch competition and Awards Gala evening. Readers can watch both events live from this page. The Anzisha Prize is Africa’s biggest award for her youngest entrepreneurs, and hands out over USD $100,000 every year in funding to the top 20 of Africa’s very youngest and brightest entrepreneurs. Every year the Prize hosts an Awards Gala where the young entrepreneurs are awarded their prize money and the grand prize winners are announced. The day before, it hosts a pitch competition where finalists present their businesses to the world in front of a panel of renowned judges. This year, for the first time, the pitch competition will be live streamed across the continent on October 22. Online audiences will have the opportunity to tune into the pitch competition and rally behind the entrepreneurs who inspire them most, possibly motivating them to begin their own entrepreneurial journey. The pitching event will be hosted by Cameroonian Tonje Bakang, a tech entrepreneur who created Africa’s Netflix, Afrostream and a long-time supporter of young entrepreneurs. The winners will be announced during an extraordinary gala evening on October 23, which will include a keynote address from Sim Shagaya, a Nigerian entrepreneur who is the founder and former CEO of Konga.com, one of West Africa’s largest electronic commerce websites.
