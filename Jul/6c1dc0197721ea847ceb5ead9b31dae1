Mapongwana Attorneys Incorporated is a black woman-owned boutique law firm based in Sandton. We provide practical and cost effective legal solutions to businesses experiencing corporate commercial law and commercial litigation challenges. Our expertise makes us a trusted legal partner for our clients. I used savings from bonuses earned from a previous job. It would go into business infrastructure, particularly IT and human capital. The best have been word of mouth, client referrals, website visitors, social media and of course, radio. I landed a big corporate client and successfully settled the matter. This was a great achievement for the firm and a good way to make a first impression with the client. I once received an urgent instruction from a client and in the haste to meet the deadline, omitted to sign an engagement letter, everything was verbal. I have learnt to follow the firmâ€™s internal processes no matter how urgent the matter is.
