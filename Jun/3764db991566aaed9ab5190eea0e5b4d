She explains why: Tomorrow’s world is moving toward wireless electricity, energy-saving devices, and new technologies to provide energy. Looking at scarcity or total absence of energy in rural areas, Africa needs these inventions. Solar and wind technologies have already made their niches. However, energy from [the] sea, magnetic energy, and clean fuel-cell energy remain untapped. For instance, Bloom Energy is an exciting solution for clean energy. I believe that energy produced [off-grid] can go a long way to solve Africa’s challenge of delivering energy in every house. Clean energy will be welcome in today’s polluted environment.
